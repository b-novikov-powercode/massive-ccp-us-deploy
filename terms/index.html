          ("ELifeQuotes.us", "ELifeQuotes.us", "we" or "us"), is the owner and operator of the ELifeQuotes.us website
          (together with all content, tools, and services provided on or in connection with such website, the
          "Website"). You must be a resident of the United States (including its territorial possessions) and at least
          eighteen (18) years of age to access and use the Website. By accessing, browsing or using this Website, or
          any page thereof, through any direct or indirect means, or by using the tools, forms or services offered in
          or through the Website, you accept and agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Use and the Agreement.
          THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ALL CLAIMS AND CONTAINS DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AND
          LIABILITY (please see sections 5 and 8). These provisions form an essential basis of our bargain. If you do
          not agree to these terms and conditions, you are not authorized to access or use the Website and you are to
          cease accessing or otherwise using the Website. For purposes of this Agreement, "you" or "your" means the
          person(s) using the Website and/or any tools, forms or services offered in or through the Website. If you
          are using the Website on behalf of an employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the
          authority to bind such entity to the Agreement.</p> <p>ELifeQuotes.us shall have the right at any time to change or discontinue any aspect or feature of the
          Website and the right to modify the terms and conditions applicable to users of the Website, including these
          Terms of Use, or any part hereof. Such changes, modification, additions or deletions shall be effective
          immediately upon posting on the Website. When we post changes to these terms of use OR our PRIVACY POLICY,
          we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of the applicable document. Accordingly, you should
          periodically check the "last updated" date at the top of each document so that you can familiarize yourself
          with any changes. Any use by you of the Website or the tools, forms or services offered in or through the
          Websites following such posting shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of such changes.</p> <h4>2. PRIVACY POLICY</h4> <p>Please review our Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement, for
          detailed information about our policies and practices applicable to the information that is collected
          through the Website or received directly from you, including the sharing of such information with third
          parties and its use for advertising and other purposes. By accessing or using the Website, you consent to
          the collection, storage, use and disclosure of your information as described in the Privacy Policy (as it
          may be changed from time to time, as described more fully in the Privacy Policy).</p> <h4>3. MATCHING TOOLS AND SERVICES</h4> <p>Our Website provides tools and services to help you find insurance coverage or quotes for insurance
          coverage, all of which are provided by third parties unaffiliated with ELifeQuotes.us (collectively,
          "Insurers"). "Insurers" includes insurance companies, ELifeQuotes.us's marketing partners, and affiliates or
          finders working on behalf of insurance companies, with whom we may share your information (as described in
          our Privacy Policy) for the purpose of enabling you to find affordable insurance coverage. You may be able
          to access these products and services when you complete a request or submit your zip code or other
          information and either (i) get matched with potential Insurers who will respond with quotes or conditional
          offers for products or services, or (ii) get provided with the name and information about potential Insurers
          who may able to respond with the requested products or services or information about the requested products
          or services without any quotes or offers. The Insurers that can provide you with insurance quotes or
          conditional offers may not respond with offers until they obtain additional information from you. You may
          not be matched with the Insurer making any specific quote or offer.</p> <p>Although ELifeQuotes.us is compensated by its network of Insurers when we display advertisements for their
          products to you and/or when you respond to a quote or offer for insurance or another product from an Insurer
          on our Website, ELifeQuotes.us is not a provider of insurance, is not acting as an Insurer or broker, and
          does not make any decisions in connection with the underwriting or offering of any insurance products. Any
          compensation from Insurers is payment for ELifeQuotes.us's services, tools, and facilities. Your use of the
          Website and/or ELifeQuotes.us's services constitutes your agreement with this compensation arrangement.</p> <p>ELifeQuotes.us does not endorse or recommend the products of any particular Insurer. Nor is ELifeQuotes.us
          an agent of you or any Insurer. Our services are only administrative. You should rely on your own judgment
          in deciding which available insurance policy or other product, terms and Insurer best suits your needs and
          financial means. The Insurer is solely responsible for its products and services, and you agree that
          ELifeQuotes.us shall not be liable for any damages or costs of any type arising out of or in any way
          connected with your use of such products or services. You understand that Insurers may keep your insurance
          request information and any other information provided by ELifeQuotes.us or received by them in the
          processing of your request, whether or not you are qualified for insurance with them or if you obtain
          insurance from them. You agree to notify any particular Insurer directly if you no longer want to receive
          communications from them. ELifeQuotes.us is not responsible for any errors or delays in responding to a
          request or referral form caused by, including but not limited to, an incorrect email address provided by you
          or other technical problems beyond our reasonable control.</p> <p>The Website and the products and services provided or advertised on the Website may not be available in all
          states, and the availability of such services and the products offered on the Website may change from to
          time without notice. Insurers are not attempting to offer insurance outside of their authorized states or

          terminate the offering of any insurance or other product in any specific state through the Website at any
          time, without prior notice.</p> <p>The information provided by ELifeQuotes.us whether on this website or discussed during any call does not
          represent a guarantee of coverage or specific payment. All insurance plans are subject to the terms,
          conditions, and limitations of the specific policy issued, including, but not limited to, eligibility,
          pre-certification, exclusions and limitations, and medical necessity requirements. For further information
          on a policy and its limitations, please call <a href="tel:18669488235">1-866-948-8235</a>.</p> <p>The data and other information you may provide ELifeQuotes.us is not, and is not treated as, an application
          for insurance or a request to be pre-approved, pre-qualified or any similar concept. ELifeQuotes.us does not
          guarantee acceptance into any particular insurance program or specific terms or conditions with any Insurer;
          insurance approval standards are established and maintained solely by individual Insurers. Likewise,
          ELifeQuotes.us does not guarantee that the insurance terms or rates offered and made available by Insurers
          are the best terms or lowest rates available in the market. An Insurer's offer may be subject to market
          conditions, approval, and qualification (including review of your driving record). The rates and fees
          actually provided by Insurers may be higher or lower depending on your complete profile and other
          considerations used by Insurers, such as your driving record. Unless expressly stated in writing, nothing
          contained herein shall constitute an offer or promise for an insurance commitment or a rate lock-in
          agreement. Insurers may not offer all products as well as not offer products in all states. You might not be
          matched with the Insurer making any specific offer. To help the government fight identity theft, the funding
          of terrorism and money laundering activities, and to help attempt to verify your identity, Insurers may
          obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who applied for or obtain insurance from
          them. For example, they may ask for your name, Social Security Number or driver's license number, address,
          date of birth, and other important information, that will allow the proper identification of you. During the
          Insurer application process, they may also ask to see additional information. ELifeQuotes.us does not charge
          you a fee for its service in matching you with Insurers.</p> <p>By clicking on any button indicating an acceptance or agreement to terms, a continuance of processing, a
          request for quotes or any other submission ("submission"), you understand that you are agreeing to the
          stated terms and conditions of that submission and that you are submitting an inquiry as to insurance or
          another product through ELifeQuotes.us to each of the Insurers to whom your request is transmitted.</p> <p>You agree that by providing your telephone number in any submission within ELifeQuotes.us's webpages that
          you are providing your signature expressly consenting to receive calls, emails, postal mail, text messages,
          and other forms of communication from up to eight companies such as these companies including calls made
          with an automatic telephone dialing system or prerecorded voice to the wireless or residential telephone
          number you provided even if you are on a state or federal Do Not Call registry. You acknowledge and
          understand that your wireless carrier may impose charges for these calls or texts and consent to receive
          communications is not a condition of purchase. You may revoke your consent at any time.</p> <p>By including your email in any submission, you are extending an express invitation to each Insurer you have
          been matched with to contact you by email at any email address you provided (in this case, any such email
          from an Insurer will not be considered spam or unauthorized by any local, state or federal law or
          regulation). For any service, you represent that all of the information you have provided in your submission
          is true and complete.</p> <p>ELifeQuotes.us seeks to provide you multiple insurance quotes through its network of unaffiliated Insurers.
          By submitting information on an insurance request form or similar form, you authorize us to provide such
          information to Insurers in order to help you complete your request. Additionally, by submitting a request
          for insurance, you authorize the Insurers to verify the accuracy and authenticity of all information
          supplied by you, both internally and with the assistance of unaffiliated third parties.</p> <p>To determine which Insurers may be matched with you, Insurers provide to us criteria about the type of
          insurance and the type of customer (for example, state of residence) in which the Insurer is interested.
          ELifeQuotes.us will provide your information to Insurers whose criteria match your profile. Where it is
          discovered that you do not meet certain Insurers' criteria or you do not qualify for their products, you
          also authorize us to provide your information to other Insurers whose criteria match your profile and whose
          products we feel might be of help in completing your request.</p> <h4>4. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENSES</h4> <p>You are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, revocable license to use and

          ELifeQuotes.us and its affiliates, suppliers and Insurers, and its and their respective members, managers,

          website, nor is it liable for any direct or indirect technical or system issues arising out of your access

          be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States of America and State of
          Delaware (without regard to conflict of law principles). Should a dispute arise concerning the terms and
          conditions of the Agreement, the breach of same by any party hereto, THE WEBSITE or any products or services
          provided by ELifeQuotes.us, the parties agree to submit their dispute for resolution by arbitration before
          the American Arbitration Association, in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of
          the American Arbitration Association. Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive to the parties and a
          judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing herein shall be construed to
          preclude any party from seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending arbitration or to
          protect ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. To the extent permitted by law, you agree that you will not bring, join
          or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy that you may have against
          ELifeQuotes.us, its affiliates and/or their respective employees, officers, directors, members, managers,
          shareholders, representatives and assigns. You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a
          lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in the suit. You agree to pay the attorneys' fees and court costs
          that ELifeQuotes.us incurs in seeking such relief. This provision preventing you from bringing, joining or
          participating in class action lawsuits is an independent agreement and does not constitute a waiver of any
          of your rights and remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration
          as provided above. If any provision contained in the Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or
          unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law, then such provision will be severed and replaced with
          a new provision that most closely reflects the original meaning of the severed provision while conforming to
          applicable law, and the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Should a
          dispute arise between the parties and should the arbitration provisions herein become inapplicable or
          unenforceable, or in any instance of any lawsuit between you and ELifeQuotes.us, the parties agree that
          jurisdiction over and venue of any suit shall be exclusively in the state of Delaware. If either party
          employs attorneys to enforce any right in connection with a dispute or lawsuit, the prevailing party shall
          be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees. This arbitration agreement includes claims related to our
          clients, vendors, and Marketing Partners, which are third party beneficiaries of this arbitration
          agreement</p> <h4>9. WEBSITE PROVIDED FROM THE UNITED STATES</h4> <p>If you are using the Website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information will be
