          privacy of our consumer users ("you" or "your") and has developed this Privacy Policy to demonstrate its
          commitment to protecting your privacy. If you are an individual who is a user of this website, who accesses
          or responds to advertisements or offers e-mailed or displayed to you relating to this website, or who is
          otherwise as a user of the services provided by ELifeQuotes.us, this Privacy Policy is intended to describe
          for you, among other things:</p> <ul><li>The information we collect about you</li> <li>How we use the information we collect</li> <li>With whom we share your information</li> <li>How you can access your information</li> <li>Your choices about collection and use of your information</li></ul> <p>How we protect your personal information</p> <p>We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our website or services, responding to
          our advertisements and offers, or transacting business with us. By using our website, you are accepting the
          practices described in this Privacy Policy. (This Privacy Policy does not apply to our vendors, contractors
          and employees.)</p> <p>If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for
          information on how to contact us.</p> <h4>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h4> <p><b>In General.</b> We may collect personal information that can identify you such as your name and e-mail
          address, as well as other information that does not identify you such as your zip code. When you provide
          personal information through our website, the information may be sent to ELifeQuotes.us servers located in
          the United States and other countries around the world.</p> <p><b>Information You Provide.</b> As mentioned above, we may collect information you submit on our website,
          such as your name, e-mail address and zip code. We may also track your interaction with email advertisements
          sent to you by ELifeQuotes.us or our e-mail service providers on our behalf (for example, when you register,
          purchase, or browse in response to such emails).</p> <p><b>Information from Other Sources.</b> We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal
          information about you from business partners, contractors and other third parties, as well as information
          from public databases. Examples of information that we may receive include information about your home and
          additional demographic information.</p> <p><b>Use of Cookies and Other Technologies to Automatically Collect Information.</b> We and our authorized
          service providers, advertising companies, and ad networks may use various activity tracking technologies,
          such as cookies, pixels and web beacons, to collect information from your computer and about your activities
          on our website or interaction with our advertisements (see "Information Collected by Third Parties" below).
          We and these companies may automatically collect information from your browser when you visit our website.
          This information may include your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of
          any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us or them (see "Cookies" below) and the
          referring website address.</p> <p><b>Cookies.</b> When you visit our website, we may assign your computer one or more cookies, to facilitate
          access to our website, to personalize your online experience, and to record information about your visit to
          our website. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows your
          computer's browser to store your preferences and allows ELifeQuotes.us, our authorized service providers,
          advertising companies and ad networks to identify you by a unique identifier and associate this with
          corresponding information in our or their database. Through the use of a cookie, we and these companies may
          store your non-personally identifiable registration information and user preferences and may also
          automatically collect information about your online activity on websites, such as the web pages you visit,
          the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions you conduct while on websites. In addition,
          ELifeQuotes.us may set a cookie on your computer when you view our advertisements delivered on or in
          connection with a third-party website you are visiting. After a cookie is set, ELifeQuotes.us may track how
          you interact with the advertisement (for example, registering, purchasing, browsing, etc.). Most browsers
          automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you
          choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to use some of the interactive features
          offered on our website. We do not tie tracking cookies used for behavioral or targeted advertising purposes
          to any personal information you submit while on our website; however, cookies may be tied to your personal
          information for purposes of matching you with insurance companies and managing our relationships with these
          companies and other websites from which you may have been referred to us. They do NOT, however, collect
          personal information. Although we may place or allow third parties to place their cookies when you visit our
          website (as described more fully in the subsection below entitled "Targeted or Behavioral Advertising"), we
          do not have access or control over third party cookies, nor does our Privacy Policy cover the use of cookies
          by third parties.</p> <p><b>Other Technologies.</b> We may use other standard Internet activity tracking technologies, such as web
          beacons and similar technologies, to track your use on our website or your interaction with our
          advertisements. A web beacon is a programming code used to display an image on a web page and can also
          transfer an individual's user identification to a database and associate the individual with previously
          acquired information about the individual. Such information may be used in targeted or behavioral
          advertising, as well as for the other uses described in this paragraph. We may include web beacons in
          promotional e-mail messages or newsletters or online advertisements to determine whether messages have been
          opened or acted upon. We may use the information we obtain in this manner to customize the services and
          offers we provide our website's visitors, to deliver targeted advertisements, and to measure the overall
          effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities. We do not tie web beacons
          to any personal information you submit while on our website.</p> <h4>INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THIRD PARTIES.</h4> <p><b>Targeted or Behavioral Advertising</b></p> <p>Targeted advertising (also known as behavioral advertising) uses information collected on an individual's
          web browsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information
          is then used to select which ELifeQuotes.us advertisement should be displayed to a particular individual on
          websites other than an ELifeQuotes.us site. For example, if you have shown a preference for life insurance
          products while visiting an ELifeQuotes.us, site, you may be served an advertisement from or about the
          ELifeQuotes.us site for life insurance when you visit a site other than the ELifeQuotes.us site. The
          information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include
          any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card
          number. The information used for targeted advertising either comes from the ELifeQuotes.us site you are
          visiting or through third party website publishers.</p> <p>In addition, we may place (or allow third parties to place) cookies and pixels on our website which enable
          our authorized service providers, advertising companies and advertising networks to collect information
          about our users who view or interact with their or our advertisements on our website or complete certain
          actions on our site, such as submitting a form. However, we do not tie these cookies and pixels to personal
          information that you submit on our website. The information collected by the cookies and pixels allows us
          and our partner companies to deliver, and gauge the effectiveness of, targeted advertisements, both on our
          website and when you are browsing other websites. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be
          advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (www.networkadvertising.org),
          which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies.</p> <p><b>Storage of Information We Collect</b></p> <p>We may store the personal information described above as necessary to accomplish the business purposes for
          which it was collected, as well as to comply with our legal and audit obligations, resolve reported and
          potential disputes, and enforce our agreements. We also maintain an information security program that limits
          storage of personal information to what is needed to fulfill our reasonable business, legal and audit
          requirements.</p> <h4>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4> <p>In general. We may use information that we collect about you to:</p> <ul><li>deliver the products and services that you have requested (for example, to provide you with life
            insurance quotes and/or match you with insurance companies);
          </li> <li>send you offers that you have opted in to receive;</li> <li>manage your relationship with us and provide you with customer support;</li> <li>perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our products, services or content, or
            products, services or content offered by others;
          </li> <li>communicate with you by e-mail, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services
            that may be of interest to you either from us or third parties;
          </li> <li>develop and display content and advertising (such as targeted ads) tailored to your interests on our
            websites and other websites;
          </li> <li>enforce our terms and conditions;</li> <li>protect ELifeQuotes.us, our websites, our customers and/or our other users from fraud, hacking or other
            harm;
          </li> <li>cooperate with legal, criminal or regulatory investigations or proceedings;</li> <li>manage our business; and</li> <li>perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of information collection.</li></ul> <h4>WITH WHOM WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</h4> <p>We do not share, sell, rent or trade your personal information with third parties other than as disclosed
          within this Privacy Policy.</p> <p>We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected
          about you or your activities on our website, while using our services or in your other interactions (such as
          responding to e-mails) with us.</p> <p>We may share your personal information with the following third parties:</p> <p><b>Authorized Service Providers.</b> We may share your personal information with our authorized service
          providers that perform certain services on our behalf. For example, we may engage other companies to provide
          data storage, to assist in marketing ELifeQuotes.us products or services, to conduct audits, to provide web
          analytics, and to provide hosting, design, development and other operations which make our website work.
          Other third-party service providers may help us communicate with you through e-mail. Our policy is to permit
          these third-party service providers to obtain only the personal information they need to provide the
          services, and to require them to protect personal information to the same extent as ELifeQuotes.us,
          including not using it for any improper purpose.</p> <p><b>Business Partners.</b> When you express interest in products, services or promotions offered through our
          website or our services, we may share your expression of interest with the businesses with which we partner
          to offer you those products, services and promotions, and, as applicable, their affiliates and third-party
          finder or marketing companies. When you elect to engage in a particular offer or program, you authorize us
          to provide your e-mail address, phone number, and other information to those businesses.</p> <p><b>Marketers.</b> From time to time, where permitted by applicable law, we may share your personal
          information and automatically collected or aggregated information about you with reputable direct marketers
          so that they may offer products and services, which we hope, will be of interest to you. Please see the
          section below entitled "Your Choices About Collection and Use of Your Information" for detailed information
          on your choices regarding your personal information.</p> <p><b>Insurance Companies.</b> If you provide your zip code, we will find insurance companies in your area
          whom we think may be of interest to you. Once you submit your zip code and select the company you wish to
          obtain a quote from, you will then be redirected to that third party site and provide information to them
          directly. Because the insurance companies and other partners on the ELifeQuotes.us network with whom you are
          matched may retain or use your personal information whether or not you qualify for, or obtain, insurance or
          another product from them, you should contact these persons directly concerning their privacy and
          information sharing practices.</p> <p><b>Affiliates.</b> We may share information we collect, including personal information, with other
          companies affiliated with ELifeQuotes.us (some of which are nonfinancial companies). Sharing information
          with such companies enables us to provide you with information about a variety of products and services that
          might interest you. These companies will comply with this Privacy Policy and applicable privacy and security
          laws and, at a minimum, in any commercial e-mail they send to you, will give you the opportunity to choose
          not to receive such e-mail messages from that company in the future by providing an unsubscribe link in each
          communication.</p> <p><b>Special Notice to Vermont Residents.</b> ELifeQuotes.us will not share any personal information about
          you with other affiliated companies to the extent prohibited by applicable Vermont law or to the extent your
          prior consent to share is required by applicable Vermont law.</p> <p>Other Situations. We also may disclose your information:</p> <p>(1) In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order or a request for cooperation
          from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend
          against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.</p> <p>(2) When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, or to prevent or
          take other action regarding, illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend
          the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees or others; or to enforce our
          website's terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.</p> <p>(3) In the event ELifeQuotes.us goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by
          another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, your
          personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via
          email or prominent notice on our website for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your
          personal information.</p> <p>Please note that information may also be collected by third parties such as advertising companies and
          advertising networks via third-party cookies and pixels on our site (please see the subsection above
          entitled "Targeted or Behavioral Advertising" for details).</p> <p>Any third parties to whom we may disclose or who may collect personal information may have their own
          privacy policies that describe how they use and disclose personal information. Except for companies
          affiliated with ELifeQuotes.us and authorized service providers, who agree to comply with this Privacy
          Policy with respect to personal information we share with them, the third parties' privacy policies will
          govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third
          parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we
          encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located
          either inside or outside the United States.</p> <p><b>Aggregated and Non-Personal Information.</b> We may share aggregated information (i.e., information
          about you and other customers collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) and other non-personal
          information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and
          affiliated companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third
          parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information
          collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including
          advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example,
          we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services
          accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website
          content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and
          advertising.</p> <p><b>Third-Party Websites.</b> There are a number of places on our websites where you may click on a link to
          access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an
          advertisement, an insurance quote or a search result on our websites, you may be taken to a website that we
          do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including
          personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on
          those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit
          by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</p> <h4>HOW YOU CAN ACCESS YOUR INFORMATION</h4> <p>If your personal information changes, or if you would no longer like us to contact you, you may correct,
          update, or request deletion by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@elifequotes.us">info@ELifeQuotes.us</a>.
        </p> <p>We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you services. We may also retain and use
          your information as necessary to comply with our legal and audit obligations, resolve reported and potential
          disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you wish to request that we no longer use your information to
          provide you services, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@elifequotes.us">info@ELifeQuotes.us</a>. We
          ask individual users to identify
          themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing all such
          requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require
          disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for
          instance, requests concerning information residing on backups), or for which access is not otherwise
          required. All requests are also subject to the next section below ("Your Choices About Collection and Use of
          Your Information").</p> <p>We also maintain an information security program that limits storage of personal information to what is
          needed to fulfill our reasonable business, legal and audit requirements.</p> <h4>YOUR CHOICES ABOUT COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h4> <p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use
          certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to apply for or
          obtain products or services.</p> <p>If you would like to delete the personal information that we have collected from you, please send your
          request via e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@elifequotes.us">info@ELifeQuotes.us</a>. We will process your
          request, where possible and subject to the
          terms and conditions contained in this Privacy Policy, within a reasonable period of time after receipt.
          However, federal and state regulations and/or the need to administer our relationships with our ad networks
          and other third parties may require that we store certain information for various periods of time. In order
          to comply with these requirements, we may be unable to delete your information from our database until the
          expiration of the applicable period. However, we will use reasonable commercial efforts to delete your
          personal information no later than three (3) months after receiving your request, unless a longer retention
          period is required by law. Please also be aware that if you request us to delete your personal information,
          your request will apply only to information held by us and not to information we have already shared with
          third parties; the treatment of such information held by third parties is governed by those parties' privacy
          policies, not by this Privacy Policy.</p> <p>If you receive e-mail messages or newsletters from us, you will be given the opportunity, in any commercial
          e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10
          business days for us to fully process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and
          relationship e-mail communications, such as requests for additional information, confirmations, service
          updates or announcements, administrative notices and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt
          out of receiving them. Please note that opting out of receipt of commercial e-mail communications will only
          affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third
          party before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change your
          preferences directly with that third party.</p> <h4>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4> <p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic, and procedural measures) to help
          safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, with regard to
          ELifeQuotes.us's internal operations, only authorized employees and authorized third party service providers
          are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. We
          follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both
          during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
          electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p> <h4>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h4> <p>If you are a resident of California, in addition to the rights set forth in this Privacy Policy, you have
          the right to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of
          personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. California law gives you the
          right to send us a request at a designated address to receive the following information:</p> <ul><li>the categories of information we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during
            the preceding calendar year;
          </li> <li>the names and addresses of the third parties that received that information; and</li> <li>if the nature of the third party's business cannot be determined from their name, examples of the
            products or services marketed.
          </li></ul> <p>We may provide this information in a standardized format that is not specific to you. The designated e-mail
          address for these requests is <a href="mailto:info@elifequotes.us">info@ELifeQuotes.us</a>. Please note that
          we are only required to respond to one
          request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than
          through this e-mail address or mailing address. Please also be aware that not all information sharing is
          covered by the California requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our
          response.</p> <p><b>Full California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Privacy Notice Here -
